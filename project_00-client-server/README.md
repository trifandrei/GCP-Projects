What is a DDOS attack ?

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.From a high level, a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging up the highway, preventing regular traffic from arriving at its destination. DDoS attacks are carried out with networks of Internet-connected machines. These individual devices are referred to as bots (or zombies), and a group of bots is called a botnet. When a victim’s server or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot sends requests to the target’s IP address, potentially causing the server or network to become overwhelmed, resulting in a denial-of-service to normal traffic.Because each bot is a legitimate Internet device, separating the attack traffic from normal traffic can be difficult. The most obvious symptom of a DDoS attack is a site or service suddenly becoming slow or unavailable. 

What is OSI Model?

OSI Model, open systems interconnection, is a standard that allows different computer systems to communicate with each oder.
It consists of 7 abstract layers, every of them having importance in establishing the communication between computers.
The Application Layer (7th layer) is the one where applications can access the network services
The Presentation Layer (6th layer) prepares data for the 7th layer and here is defined how devices should encode, encrypt and compress data so that the other device will receive it corectly
The Session Layer (5th layer) created communication channels and ensures that they are open and functional and after the data is transfered it closes the sessions
The Transport Layer (4th layer) carries the data from the session layer using transmission protocols
The Network Layer (3rd layer) takes the data from the transport layer and finds the best path on which the data will be transmitted
The DataLink Layer (2nd layer) is establishing the connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network and uses LLC(Logical Link Control) to checks the data and MAC(Media Access Control) to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data
The Physical Layer (1st layer) is responsible for transmission of raw data over the cables or wireless connection

What is git?

Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating  system kernel. 
Performance: Git are very strong when compared to many alternatives. The algoritm implemented inde Git to commiting new changes, branching, merging and comparing past verions are all optimezed for performance. 
Security: Git has been gesigned with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured
Flexibility: One of Git's key design objectives is flexibility. Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.
