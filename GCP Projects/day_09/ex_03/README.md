relational vs non-relational databases?


A Relational Database is a collection of items with pre-established relationships among them. All the items are organised in tables, where columns represent items attributes. Every row of a table represents a single data item.
In order to identify each item in a table uniquely, a primary key should be defined for each table. A primary key could contain one or more columns of a table. Multiple tables could be related through different foreign keys.

A Non Relational Database is a collection of unstructured, structured or semi-structured items, usually represented in the form key-value. Every item in the collection may either represent a document, a table or anything else.
Usually, different items in the same or in different collections are not related each other, although a reference (such an identifier) can be added to an item to refer another item.
