List comprehension in Python is an easy and compact syntax for creating a list from a string or another list. It is a very concise way to create a new list by performing an operation on each item in the existing list. List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the for loop. One of the big advantages of list comprehension is that they allow developers to write less code that is often easier to understand.
