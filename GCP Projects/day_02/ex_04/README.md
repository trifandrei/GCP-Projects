Dictionary comprehension is a method for transforming one dictionary into another dictionary. During this transformation, items within the original dictionary can be conditionally included in the new dictionary and each item can be transformed as needed.Both list and dictionary comprehension are a part of functional programming which aims to make coding more readable and create list and dictionary in a crisp way without explicitly using for loop.
