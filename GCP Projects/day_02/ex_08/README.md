The top command allows users to monitor processes and system resource usage on Linux. It is one of the most useful tools in a sysadmin’s toolbox, and it comes pre-installed on every distribution. Unlike other commands such as ps, it is interactive, and you can browse through the list of processes, kill a process, and so on. Here are the columns that will show after running the command top
ID: Shows task’s unique process id, PR: Stands for priority of the task.
SHR: Represents the amount of shared memory used by a task, VIRT: Total virtual memory used by the task.
USER: User name of owner of task, %CPU: Represents the CPU usage.
TIME+: CPU Time, the same as ‘TIME’, but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.
SHR: Represents the Shared Memory size (kb) used by a task.
NI: Represents a Nice Value of task. A Negative nice value implies higher priority, and positive Nice value means lower priority.
%MEM: Shows the Memory usage of task.
