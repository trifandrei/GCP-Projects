A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.A thread is also called a lightweight process. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. Each thread belongs to exactly one process and no thread can exist outside a process. Each thread represents a separate flow of control.
