In the IPv4 IP address space, there are five classes: A, B, C, D and E. Each class has a specific range of IP addresses . Primarily, class A, B, and C are used by the majority of devices on the Internet. Class D and class E are for special uses.The first bit of the first octet is always set to 0 (zero). Thus the first octet ranges from 1 â€“ 127.Class A addresses only include IP starting from 1.x.x.x to 126.x.x.x only. The IP range 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback IP addresses.An IP address which belongs to class B has the first two bits in the first octet set to 10.Class B IP Addresses range from 128.0.x.x to 191.255.x.x. The default subnet mask for Class B is 255.255.x.x. The first octet of Class C IP address has its first 3 bits set to 110,Class C IP addresses range from 192.0.0.x to 223.255.255.x. The default subnet mask for Class C is 255.255.255.x.Very first four bits of the first octet in Class D IP addresses are set to 1110.Class D has IP address range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. Class D is reserved for Multicasting.This IP Class is reserved for experimental purposes only for R&D or Study. IP addresses in this class ranges from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254. Like Class D, this class too is not equipped with any subnet mask.
