A virtual machine is a digital version of a physical computer. Virtual machine software can run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and do other computing functions, and requires maintenance such as updates and system monitoring. Multiple VMs can be hosted on a single physical machine, often a server, and then managed using virtual machine software. This provides flexibility for compute resources (compute, storage, network) to be distributed among VMs as needed, increasing overall efficiency. This architecture provides the basic building blocks for the advanced virtualized resources we use today, including cloud computing.
