The external IP address or a public IP address is an IP address that can be accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to your network router by your internet service provider (ISP).
Your personal device also has a private IP that remains hidden when you connect to the internet through your routerâ€™s public IP. A private IP address is the address your network router assigns to your device. Each device within the same network is assigned a unique private IP address (sometimes called a private network address)  this is how devices on the same internal network talk to each other. Private IP addresses let devices connected to the same network communicate with one another without connecting to the entire internet. By making it more difficult for an external host or user to establish a connection, private IPs help bolster security within a specific network, like in your home or office.
