Microservice architecture?

Microservices (or microservices architecture) are a cloud native architectural approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components, or services. As the constituent services are small, they can be built by one or more small teams from the beginning separated by service boundaries which make it easier to scale up the development effort if need be.Once developed, these services can also be deployed independently of each other and hence its easy to identify hot services and scale them independent of whole application.Another advantage which a microservices architecture brings to the table is making it easier to choose the technology stack (programming languages, databases, etc.) which is best suited for the required functionality (service) instead of being required to take a more standardized, one-size-fits-all approach.
