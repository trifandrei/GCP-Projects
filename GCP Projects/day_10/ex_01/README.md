What are Message-oriented middlewares?

Message Oriented Middleware is a concept that involves the passing of data between applications using a communication channel that carries self-contained units of information (messages). In a MOM-based communication environment, messages are usually sent and received asynchronously. Using message-based communications, applications are abstractly decoupled; senders and receivers are never aware of each other. Instead, they send and receive messages to and from the messaging system. It is the responsibility of the messaging system (MOM) to get the messages to their intended destinations.
