what is BigQuery?

BigQuery is a fully managed and serverless data warehouse solution available in the Google Cloud Platform that gives anyone the capability to analyze terabytes of data in a matter of seconds.The Google BigQuery architecture is based on Dremel, a distributed system created by Google to query large datasets, however, that’s just scratching the surface of what’s going on with BigQuery.BigQuery stores data in a columnar format, achieving a high compression ratio and scan throughput. However, you can also use BigQuery with data stored in other Google Cloud services such as BigTable, Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL and Google Drive.As a fully managed service, it works out of the box without the need to install, configure and operate any infrastructure.A key limitation and drawback is that BigQuery only works with data stored within Google Cloud and using their own storage services.
