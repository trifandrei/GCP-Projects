Buckets are the basic containers that hold data. Everything that we store in Cloud Storage must be contained in a bucket. We can use buckets to organize our data and control access to our data, but unlike directories and folders, we cannot nest buckets. Bucket names have more restrictions than object names and must be globally unique, because every bucket resides in a single Cloud Storage namespace.
