Key differences between static vs dynamic routing:

In static routing, routing tables are manually updated, while in dynamic routing, tables are automatically updated.
The static routing is best for small network implementation and star topologies. It is not as good for any other topologies. Whereas dynamic routing is best for a large network implementation. it is good for network topologies that consist of redundant links.
Static Routing requires less bandwidth than dynamic routing, where dynamic routing requires large bandwidth.
In static routing routes, the path is updated by the user or an administrator, while in dynamic routing, routes are updated automatically.
Static Routing does not use any routing protocols and algorithms, while dynamic routing uses routing protocols and complex algorithms to calculate routing operations.
Static Routing is known for non-adaptive routing, while dynamic routing is known for adaptive routing.
Static routes require a small administrative distance than the dynamic route.
In static routing, routes not react with network changes, while in dynamic routing, routes react with network changes.
Static Routing does not require a license, while dynamic routing requires a license. Also, in static routing, link failure disturbs routing is in process. While in dynamic routing, link failure does not disturb routing is in process.
