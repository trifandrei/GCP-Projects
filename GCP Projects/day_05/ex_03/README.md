what is Cloud Datastore and how it works ?

Datastore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. Datastore features include: Atomic transactions High availability of reads and writes Massive scalability with high performance etc.

Unlike rows in a relational database table, Datastore entities of the same kind can have different properties, and different entities can have properties with the same name but different value types. These unique characteristics imply a different way of designing and managing data to take advantage of the ability to scale automatically. In particular, Datastore differs from a traditional relational database in the following important ways:

Datastore is designed to automatically scale to very large data sets, allowing applications to maintain high performance as they receive more traffic.Datastore writes scale by automatically distributing data as necessary.

Because all queries are served by previously built indexes, the types of queries that can be executed are more restrictive than those allowed on a relational database with SQL. 
Unlike traditional relational databases which enforce a schema, Datastore is schemaless. It doesn't require entities of the same kind to have a consistent set of properties.

Objects in Datastore are known as entities. An entity has one or more named properties, each of which can have one or more values. Property values can belong to a variety of data types.Each Datastore entity is of a particular kind, which categorizes the entity for the purpose of queries

what is a REST API?

A REST API  (RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. Itâ€™s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user.
