what kind of files can be transferred using HTTP?

With http we can transfer html file, images, and text file.HTTP is used to transfer files from a Web server into a browser window to view a Web page that is on the Internet. With HTTP, files are transported only from the server onto the workstation's browser. The files are transferred but not downloaded, therefore not copied into the memory of the workstation.
